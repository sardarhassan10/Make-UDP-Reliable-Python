-> Abdul Rehman Qamar Aftab. 

Instruction:
-> This project was created using Python 2.7. Make sure you have Python 2.7 installed on your machine. 
-> Open up the files on Python Idle IDE. 
-> Run the receiver side code first, and then run the sender side code. 
-> An audio file for testing is attached in the folder. You can use it for testing/checking.
-> You can use your own audio file as well. Just make sure that you add the file to directory and change the file name in the sender side code. 
-> The audio file names are stored as string in variables at the start of each code files. 
-> Make sure you use the correct audio file names and extensions (.mp3, .mp4 etc) in both receiver and sender side codes. 
-> The receiver acts as a server, while the sender acts as a client. 
-> The audio file accessing method is stored as string in variables at the start of each code files.
-> The code comes with 'ab' (append in binary) accessing method on the receiver side. 
-> The code comes with 'rb' (read in binary) accessing method on the sender side. 
-> The 'ab' accessing method will overwrite any previous existing file with the same name. 
-> If you have the problem of the received audio file not being played after running the code many continuous times, just delete the received file and restart the receiver side code. 
-> DO NOT DELETE THE RECEIVER SIDE AUDIO FILE WHILE THE RECEIVER SIDE CODE IS RUNNING. Close the receiver side code before deleting it.
